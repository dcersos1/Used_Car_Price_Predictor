# Used Car Price Predictor

**Adam Cersosimo, Daniel Cersosimo, Owen Hovey, Vincent Ranieri**

In this project, we acquired a dataset comprised of a myriad of used cars alognside various attribiutes such as engine size, mileage, age, and of course price. From this, we performed various 
customary data science procedures with the likes of data preprocessing, EDA, ML modeling, data visualization, and more to effecilvey extract functional insight from the data while building multiple
machine learning models to estimate the price of a used car. Feel free to view our report, slides, and code itself to garner a comphrensive understanding of our project and its associated components
